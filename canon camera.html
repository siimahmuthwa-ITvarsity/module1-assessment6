        <p>The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is a 26.2-megapixel full-frame digital single-lens reflex camera announced by Canon on June 29, 2017. Impressions from the Canon press event were mixed, with many saying the camera is "a sizeable upgrade, but feels dated". Critics point out that the 6D does not support 4K video shooting and its 45 AF points are dense around the center, resulting in slower focus and recompose maneuvers when photographing moving subjects.</p>
